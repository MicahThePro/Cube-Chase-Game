# 🔴🟨 Cube Chase Game

**Cube Chase Game** is a simple but surprisingly intense browser game where YOU, a lonely red cube, have to chase and touch the elusive yellow cube before time runs out. Each level gets harder, time gets tighter, and your reflexes get tested.

WASD? Nope. Arrows. Smooth acceleration? Yup. Retro vibes with sleek modern mechanics? Absolutely.

## 🚀 Features

* ⚡️ **Physics-Based Movement**
  Velocity, friction, acceleration… it’s like a mini racing game inside a square.

* ⏱️ **Dynamic Timer System**
  Each level gives you less time. Go fast, or get embarrassed by a yellow square.

* 🌯️ **Randomized Target Spawns**
  No memorizing spawn points here. Every level's a new mini-challenge.

* 🧠 **Progressive Difficulty**
  Level 1 is chill. Level 20? Let’s just say you're gonna *feel it*.

* 💥 **Instant Restart UI**
  Clean full-screen start and retry experience.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click **Start Game**.
2. Use the arrow keys to move your cube.
